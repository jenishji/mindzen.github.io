                    and anxiety symptoms.

                    People have different thresholds for how much caffeine they can tolerate. If caffeine makes you
                    jittery or anxious, consider cutting back by replacing coffee or energy drinks with decaffeinated
                    coffee, herbal tea, or water.</p>

                    Still, people sensitive to caffeine may experience increased anxiety and stress after consuming less
