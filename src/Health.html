            <br><br>
            ->Identify and test your underlying beliefs.
            <br><br>
            ->Break massive goals down into manageable steps.
            If the goals we set around a new behavior don’t allow for learning and growing in our ability to engage in this behavior, we have set ourselves up to fail. If you knew how to successfully lose 30 pounds and keep it off, you would probably have done it long ago.

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          ->Talk about it.
          Ask for support from people who care about you and who will listen to your concerns. Receiving support and care can be comforting and reassuring. It often helps to speak with others who have shared your experience so you do not feel so different or alone.
          <br><br>
          ->Strive for balance.
          When a tragedy occurs, it’s easy to become overwhelmed and have a negative or pessimistic outlook. Balance that viewpoint by reminding yourself of people and events which are meaningful and comforting, even encouraging.
          <br><br>
          ->Turn it off and take a break.
          You may want to keep informed, but try to limit the amount of news you take in whether it’s from the Internet, television, newspapers or magazines.

        Observe your body and any physical sensations or changes during an activity, noting changes in body temperature.

      <h3>Tips to Recover Your Joy and Energy</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="overview">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
       ->First, stop beating yourself up.
       Have you been hard on yourself for not being able to “do it all”, whatever your “all” is? Or maybe your internal voices have been abusing you for not doing it perfect, better or as good as someone else in your circle or in the media.
       <br><br>
       ->There’s no such thing as perfect.
       Often striving for perfection is a mask for fear. What are you afraid of? It could be rejection, losing your job, worrying that your kid won’t have friends or get into college, etc. If you tend towards perfectionism, uncovering your fears can help you address them straight on.
       <br><br>
       ->Comparison is the death of joy.
       While some comparison may be motivating, often comparing ourselves, our bodies, jobs, vacations, social media stream, etc. adds stress and creates negative self image. Instead, think about what you do have. Make a mental note or better yet, write it down. 
       <br><br>
       ->Re-evaluate your to-do list.
       Too much of a good thing is oftentimes a bad thing. Maybe there is actually too much on your plate. You wouldn’t let your child get involved in too many extracurriculars at one time, because you know they can’t do it all without something (or everything) suffering.
       <br><br>
       ->Love yourself by taking better care of yourself.
       Sometimes we believe we can just “power through” these rough patches. However, research has shown that an ongoing maintenance plan of self-care is what makes people resilient, protecting them from stress and improving overall physical and mental health.

    <h3>Seven Tips for Staying Cool in a Stressed Out World   </h3>
  </div>
  <div class="overview">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
     1.Breathe deeply.
     Taking in deep breaths helps relax the body, slowly triggering the body to stop releasing stress hormones. <br>
     <br>
     2. Cope with Anger.
     Anger is a strong feel of annoyance, displeasure, or hostility. The experience is characterized by antagonism toward someone or something—often connected to the experience of unfairness, injustice, or someone has done me wrong. <br>
     <br>
     3.Find the Positive.
    The world is filled with pain, disappointment, hurt, trauma and abuse and lately an expected pandemic and an unforeseen war. As we face these realities, it is not hard to imagine the worst case in every scenario. Clinically knows as “catastrophic thinking”, this worst case imagining needs to be contained and challenged. <br>
    <br>
    4.Surround Yourself with Positive People. 
    Most people can identify a few people in their lives who make them feel stressed just by being around them. While it’s not always possible to cut these people out of your life entirely, boundaries are often necessary. <br>
    <br>
    5.Write Down Your Gratitude
    Staying grateful for everything you have in your life – no matter how small – can keep things in perspective and help you to maintain a positive attitude. <br>
    <br>
    6. Keep Moving.
    Regular exercise prompts the body to release feel-good hormones. Daily workouts, walks, bike rides, etc. help to clear your head. If you’re under pressure, stopping at the gym on the way home could help you to feel calmer and gain a new perspective on the situation.

  <h3>Bringing Awareness to Borderline Personality Disorder</h3>
</div>
<div class="overview">
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms in Adults
  BPD symptoms can present in many ways, often making it difficult to diagnosis. These can include, <br>
  
  1.Emotional instability and intense changes in mood <br>
  2.Impulsivity <br>
  3.Self-harm <br>
  4.Poor self-image <br>
  5.Hopeless and helpless thinking <br>
  6.Fear of being abandoned <br>
  7.Difficulty with maintaining healthy relationships <br>
  <br>One of the most effective treatments for the symptoms of BPD is Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), an evidence-based treatment that was created specifically to treat the symptoms of BPD. Its effectiveness is found in a philosophy of acceptance and change. Recent studies using MRI’s to scan the brains of individuals with BPD, showed that in just 12 weeks of DBT, the brain’s grey matter changed in response to this skill-building approach.<br>

  <h3>Mental Illness Stigma Keeps People From Seeking Help. Our Support Can Make a Difference.</h3>
</div>
<div class="overview">
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  (Mental illnesses cause disturbances in emotions, thoughts and behavior which make it difficult to cope with the ordinary demands and routines of life. Sometimes symptoms of a mental health disorder appear as physical problems, such as stomach pain, back pain, headache or other unexplained aches and pains.)
  <br><br>
  ->How You Can Help Reduce Stigma and Discrimination <br>
  1.Practice acceptance and respect.
  Individuals with mental illnesses live next door, teach our children, work in the next cubicle, and sit in the same pew at church. If we show these individuals respect and acceptance, we help remove one of the barriers to them successfully coping with their illnesses.
  <br>
  2.Know the facts.
  Educate yourself about mental health conditions. Learn the facts instead of the myths.
  <br>
  3.Educate others.
  Advocate within your circles of influence to ensure these individuals have the same rights and opportunities as everyone else.

  <h3>Tuning In to Your Healthy Inner Voice</h3>
</div>
<div class="overview">
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  We all have an inner voice. Sometimes it’s more like that shoulder angel: offering words of encouragement, giving wise advice, and coaching us through a difficult situation. Other times it’s more like that shoulder devil: criticizing, judging, talking trash to us about us, bringing us down, or telling us to give up, give in, or quit. At its worst, it can be abusive and demeaning. 
  <br><br>
  The healthiness or abusiveness of our inner voice is critical.
  It shapes our inner experience and our outer reality. By inner experience, I mean our thought processes and our emotional experience. By outer experience, I mean, that our perspective creates our reality. Thinking something is true often makes it so. It becomes true for you. Healthy or unhealthy, helpful or unhelpful, it shapes how we relate and respond by shaping our attitude, intentions, choices and actions. I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again… Be careful where you park your mind. <br><br>
  Child development experts tell us our inner voice manifests about age two or three as we acquire words and language. It arises from awareness and self-awareness. Our inner dialogue is the experience of our thought processes as we think, reflect and reason.

  <h3>Strengthening Our Mental Health: Lessons to Keep Us Moving Forward</h3>
</div>
<div class="overview">
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  ->Stay Connected.
  It can be tempting to withdraw from those around us when we’re struggling with mental health.  However, isolating negatively impacts both your mental and physical health. Make the effort to find creative ways to connect with family and friends on a daily basis. Morning meet-ups for coffee, sharing lunch at the park or evening walks around the neighborhood are all great ways to keep close with those you care about.
  <br><br>
  ->Eat Healthy.
  Ever hear the term ‘You are what you eat’? It’s true–food impacts our mood. The term “hangry” (hungry + angry) was coined because of the negative impact hunger has upon our level of irritability. A diet high in sugar, fat and caffeine can lead to crashing or making us feel sluggish and burned out without the energy needed to make it through the day.
  <br><br>
  ->Stay Hydrated.
  Our body is 75% water, making water essential for our body to function appropriately. Even mild dehydration impacts both our mood and our ability to remain alert. Substituting water for soda or other sugary drinks helps maintain your mental and physical health.
  <br><br>
  ->Contribute to a Greater Good.
  Contributing to the world around us in positive ways has a positive impact upon our mood. Take a moment to think about the people you know. Simple acts of kindness, such as asking loved ones they need anything from the grocery store or sending an unexpected uplifting message encourages them, and positively impacts your own mental health.
  <br><br>
  ->Moderate Your News Intake.
  While it is important to stay apprised of current events, watching too much news isn’t good for your mental health. In particular, the repetitive nature of news reports has been shown to negatively impact mental health. Make it a habit to limit your news consumption to once or twice a day, and consider reading instead of watching whatever news source you utilize.
  <br><br>
  ->Integrate Faith.
  Faith provides hope and purpose, especially in the midst of difficult times. Participating in a faith community provides structure and a group of people to connect with who share similar beliefs. Integrating faith and participation in a faith community into one’s life on a regular basis has been shown to reduce suicide rates, alcoholism and substance use. Work to creatively connect with your faith community on a regular basis.

  <h3>A Guide to Practicing Sitting Meditation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="overview">
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  ->Focus on your physical self
  Focusing first on your feet, simply notice your feet making contact with the floor or earth. Next bring your attention to your bottom where it makes contact with your cushion or seat. Next bring your attention to your hands, just noticing their weight and where they make contact with your lap, thighs or knees. Next bring your attention to your lips where they press together, then your closed eyes, feeling the weight of your eye lids.
  <br><br>
  ->Focus on your mental self
  When you are ready, take another turn by shifting your attention to noticing any thoughts and emotions that arise. Simply be aware of them just as they are. Bring a gently curiosity to them. You need not follow them down a rabbit hole or lose your attention by creating a storyline about them. Simply observe, notice what is present and let them go, returning each time to the breath. (This by the way is how we learn letting go).
  <br><br>
  ->Focus on your emotional self
  You may notice all sorts of emotions that may arise. They usually arise, you may notice, in the company of thoughts. Some are pleasant. Some are painful. You are learning to create a holding place or environment where feel them, accept them without judgment, be curious about them, learn from them and let them go.
  <br><br>
  ->Focus on your senses
  When you are ready, take another turn by shifting your attention outside yourself to anything your senses present from the environment around you. If your eyes are closed, you will likely be relying mainly on your sense of hearing. Simply notice the sounds as they appear. If it is steady sound, just notice that. If it is a temporary or transient sound, just notice it come and go. Notice whether it is loud or soft, whether it intensifies or fades. You may notice sounds that originate from your body: digestive sounds, your heart beat, or with respiration. Your other senses may notice sensations too, smells or tastes.
  <br><br>
  ->When you are ready, bring your attention full circle, back to your breathing.
  Return to your center from whence you started. Stay with your breathing for as long as you wish. When you are ready, allow your eyes to open slowly (if they are closed) and give your vision time to adjust to your surroundings. When you are fully alert and oriented, rise and go about your business.

  <h3>Healthier Relationships = Better Health</h3>
</div>
<div class="overview">
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  ->Family
Typical characteristics of healthy family relationships are support, mutual trust, regular interactions, shared beliefs and values, security, and a sense of community. Traditionally, family is someone related by birth, marriage or adoption. However, included in these intimate and supportive relationships are non-related people many consider family. This could be church family or close intimate friends.
<br><br>
->Friends
A friendship is a close tie between two people built upon mutual experiences, shared interests, proximity and emotional bonding. Friends turn to each other in times of hardship or crisis. Most individuals need between three and six close friendships.
<br> <br>
Romantic Relationships
When a close relationship forms built upon affection, trust, intimacy, and physical love between two people, the relationship transitions from friendship to romance. While society has elevated these relationships to the most important types of relationships, research has shown they fill different needs but are not necessarily more important.
<br><br>
Strong Communication is Key to Healthy Relationships
Relationships are living, dynamic parts of our lives which require attention, time and energy to build and maintain healthy connections.  Attending to the following skills helps create and cultivate healthy relationships:
<br><br>
Build trust.
The safe feeling trust creates enables people to be vulnerable without fearing judgment, abandonment, or betrayal. Trust is cultivated and strengthened by attending well when someone expresses a need for emotional connection or support or is disagreeing with you. By being trustworthy in these moments, you pave the way for both parties to be more open and supportive in the future.
<br><br>
Listen deeply.
One of the best ways to show someone you care is by listening to them with an open mind and your full attention. This means turning off the television and removing other distractions. Make eye contact and work to understand what the other person is saying without letting your own opinions get in the way.
<br><br>
Practice gratitude.
One of the most accessible positive emotions, gratitude strengthens friendships and intimate relationships. Expressing gratitude can be as simple as remembering to say “thank you.”
<br><br>
Learn to forgive.
Disagreements are a normal part of relationships. How you choose to handle the hurt created by disagreements is important. Choosing to forgive by letting go of the anger and hurt improves relationships and has a positive impact on you personally.

Sleep deprivation fogs our brain, causes our bodies to crave carbs and interferes with the body’s ability to metabolize them! Creating a routine around bedtime that you look forward to and adopting some good sleep hygiene habits can make it easier to maintain a healthy weight and sustain sharper focus throughout the day.

2. Give to live longer.
Doing positive things for others increases positive emotions, which boosts our immune system. Studies of older adults show a 50% increase in survival for those who have meaningful, giving relationships in their lives.
<br><br>
3. Use your vacation time to function at your best.
Daily stressors can be hard on us and can lead to problems that take away from our abilities to enjoy life. Vacation days provide us with the extended rest our minds and bodies need to stay healthy and for us to function at our very best. 
<br><br>
4. Find three good things each day to feel empowered.
Taking the time to recognize positives in our daily life encourages us, lifts our spirits and empowers us. Recent research has shown that grateful people tend to be happier, healthier and more fulfilled. 
<br><br>
5. Do something you enjoy to be a better parent, partner, you.
Putting everyone first and yourself last, usually leads to burn out…like a car that only receives gasoline and no maintenance. Taking time for self-care helps you be your best you when you’re there for others. 
<br><br>
6. Talk nice to yourself to improve your self confidence.
Positive self-talk has been shown to boost confidence, motivation and productivity, not to mention cardiovascular health, immune function and vitality.
