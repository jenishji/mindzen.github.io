        <h3> 
            10 Action Steps for Dealing with the Aftermath of a Suicide</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="overview">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        1. Coordinate
        Contain the crisis. Like the highway patrolmen on-sight at a traffic accident, postvention aims to prevent one tragedy from leading to another and return normal progression as soon as is safely possible.
        <br><br>
        2. Notify
        Protect and respect the privacy rights of the deceased employee and their loved ones during death notification.
        <br><br>
        3. Communicate
        Reduce the potential for contagion. Communicate, communicate, communicate meaningful information. Keep it simple. Make it practical. Focus on solutions to immediate issues. Repeat it. Repeat it again.
        <br><br>
        4. Support
Offer practical assistance to the family and those impacted.
<br><br>
5. Link
Identify and link impacted employees to additional support resources and refer those most affected to professional mental health services. How to lead effective suicide postvention was likely not part of most business leader’s education or training.   
<br><br>
6. Comfort
Support, comfort, and promote healthy grieving of the employees who have been impacted by the loss. Critical Incident Response consultants will guide, coach, and script leaders regarding compassionate messaging. Leaders must “give permission” for help-seeking behavior.
<br><br>
7. Restore
Restore equilibrium and optimal functioning in the workplace. Sensitively resume a familiar schedule. People do best when their natural rhythms kick back in. Routine. No surprises. One foot in front of the other just like yesterday.    
<br><br>
8. Lead The team will never forget the leader’s response. Neither will the leader. Effective provision of both guidance and support will lead to the team feeling cared for in the workplace and result in loyalty and faith in their leadership’s abilities.
<br><br>
9. Honor
Prepare for anniversary reactions and other milestone dates. Intentionally mark these dates on the calendar and then respectfully acknowledge them in large or small ways. Honor those impacted by the death.
<br><br>
10. Sustain
Transition postvention to suicide prevention. All involved stakeholders will now own the fact that “it can happen here.” Use that momentum to keep others safer. Following death by suicide leaders all become “first responders.”
