            <h3>Managing Back-to-School Anxiety</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="overview">
            <h3>Overview </h3>
            What does the emotion of fear signal? <br><br><br>
            Potential danger.:-
            Back to that rattlesnake in the woods …
            <br><br>
            Potential loss:-
            Your child is leaving home and your relationship with each other is changing.
            <br><br>
            Lack of an action plan:-
            Going to school for the first time.
            <br><br>
            Potential lack of sufficient skills for the situation,
            Such as singing in front of a large group of people
            <br><br><br>
            Solution:- <br><br>
            Creating a plan to manage fear
Each answer needs a plan and the key to any successful plan includes a willingness to tolerate the worst case scenario happening.

If my biggest fear in going to a new school is getting lost, I need to have a plan for how to deal with this (I will tour the school and find all of my classes the week before. If I still get lost, I will ask the first teacher I see to help me). I also need to be willing to tolerate the fact I might get lost. Having a plan lowers the chances of my worst case scenario happening.

            <h3> Treatment Options for Anxiety</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="overview">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            Psychotherapy
            Psychotherapy involves talking with a trained mental health professional such as a social worker, counselor, psychologist or psychiatrist to discover what caused an anxiety disorder and how to deal with its symptoms.
            
            Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) helps a person learn to recognize the thinking patterns and beliefs that fuel their anxiety and change the way they think and respond to anxiety-inducing situations. <br><br>

            Medications
Medication does not cure an anxiety disorder, but it can help keep symptoms under control. The most common medications used are antidepressants (such as SSRIs, tricyclics and MAOIs), anti-anxiety drugs (benzodiazepines) and beta-blockers. <br><br>
Complementary Treatments
Many people with anxiety disorders also benefit from joining a self-help or support groups and sharing their problems and achievements with others. <br><br>
Supportive Environment
The support of family and friends is very important to the recovery of a person with an anxiety disorder. Ideally, the family and friends would encourage their loved one as they progress through therapy and learn new coping skills rather than trivialize the disorder or demand immediate improvement.

            <h3>Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="overview">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            Social anxiety disorder, sometimes called social phobia, is characterized by excessive worry and self-consciousness about everyday social situations. Far more than shyness or unease around other people, those with social phobia have an intense, persistent and irrational fear of being watched and judged by others or of doing things that will embarrass them or lead to ridicule.
            <br><br>
            Common examples of social anxiety are public speaking or performing in front of an audience, meeting new people, eating at restaurants or going to parties. Physical symptoms that often accompany social anxiety disorder include blushing, sweating, trembling, nausea or difficulty speaking.
            <br><br>
            Symptoms can be extreme and eventually disrupt daily life. People with this disorder often find it difficult to make or keep friends, and it can prevent involvement in a romantic relationship, making those who suffer from this disorder feel completely isolated and even ashamed.
            <br><br>
            Children with social phobia tend to either avoid social situations or react with temper tantrums, crying or “freezing.” Their fears can center on social situations such as parties or talking with teachers, principals or other authority figures. Other fears include using a public restroom, talking on the phone, writing on a blackboard or reading in front of peers.
            <br><br>
            Social anxiety disorder can disrupt a child’s entire life and interfere with success in school and building social relationships. Social anxiety can also lead to other communication issues, such as selective mutism—a condition when a child might refuse to speak or has serious difficulty communicating in a stressful or fear-inducing situation.

        </div>
        <div class="overview">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          Mental health issues are prevalent on college campuses. According to National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), college students reported the following in the past year:
          <br><br>
          More than 40% felt more than an average amount of stress <br>
          More than 80% felt overwhelmed by all they had to do <br>
          73% experienced a mental health crisis on campus <br>
          50% did not seek treatment for a mental health condition <br>
          11% of college students were treated for anxiety <br>
          10% of college students were treated for depression <br>
          7% seriously considered suicide <br>

            10 Action Steps for Dealing with the Aftermath of a Suicide</h3>

        <a href="https://youtu.be/JEtNxNW0bRU?si=mD0_MnHDREj6yDIZ">Video</a>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        1. Coordinate
        Contain the crisis. Like the highway patrolmen on-sight at a traffic accident, postvention aims to prevent one tragedy from leading to another and return normal progression as soon as is safely possible.
        <br><br>
        2. Notify
        Protect and respect the privacy rights of the deceased employee and their loved ones during death notification.
        <br><br>
        3. Communicate
        Reduce the potential for contagion. Communicate, communicate, communicate meaningful information. Keep it simple. Make it practical. Focus on solutions to immediate issues. Repeat it. Repeat it again.
        <br><br>
        4. Support
Offer practical assistance to the family and those impacted.
<br><br>
5. Link
Identify and link impacted employees to additional support resources and refer those most affected to professional mental health services. How to lead effective suicide postvention was likely not part of most business leader’s education or training.   
<br><br>
6. Comfort
Support, comfort, and promote healthy grieving of the employees who have been impacted by the loss. Critical Incident Response consultants will guide, coach, and script leaders regarding compassionate messaging. Leaders must “give permission” for help-seeking behavior.
<br><br>
7. Restore
Restore equilibrium and optimal functioning in the workplace. Sensitively resume a familiar schedule. People do best when their natural rhythms kick back in. Routine. No surprises. One foot in front of the other just like yesterday.    
<br><br>
8. Lead The team will never forget the leader’s response. Neither will the leader. Effective provision of both guidance and support will lead to the team feeling cared for in the workplace and result in loyalty and faith in their leadership’s abilities.
<br><br>
9. Honor
Prepare for anniversary reactions and other milestone dates. Intentionally mark these dates on the calendar and then respectfully acknowledge them in large or small ways. Honor those impacted by the death.
<br><br>
10. Sustain
Transition postvention to suicide prevention. All involved stakeholders will now own the fact that “it can happen here.” Use that momentum to keep others safer. Following death by suicide leaders all become “first responders.”

      <h3>Increase Your Travel Enjoyment by Learning Patience</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="overview">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      *Set Realistic Expectations:-Setting realistic expectations begins when you create your travel plans. I have learned the hard way that it is important to over-estimate the amount of time it will take to do things like getting between connecting flights. I now make it a rule of thumb to always have at least an hour between connecting flights.
      <br>
      *Focus on What You Can Control :-You do control your thoughts, your feelings, and your behaviors. By focusing on these things and reminding yourself that you can’t control the lady in front of you without her driver’s license, you will lessen your frustration. <br>
      *Practice Gratitude
      Your brain is cognitively primed to focus on the things that are “wrong” or creating pain in life. This natural tendency to focus on the negative steals the joy connected to the positive elements of the trip.
      <br>
      *Deliberately Relax

    <h3>Strengthening Our Mental Health: Lessons to Keep Us Moving Forward</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="overview">
      <a href="https://youtu.be/YUnTxnMLjhc?si=_TZMOYG2DWSK5QT2">Video</a>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    *Stay Connected.
    It can be tempting to withdraw from those around us when we’re struggling with mental health.  However, isolating negatively impacts both your mental and physical health. <br><br>
    *Eat Healthy.
    Ever hear the term ‘You are what you eat’? It’s true–food impacts our mood. The term “hangry” (hungry + angry) was coined because of the negative impact hunger has upon our level of irritability.
    <br><br>
    *Stay Hydrated.
    Our body is 75% water, making water essential for our body to function appropriately. 
    <br><br>
    *Contribute to a Greater Good.
    Contributing to the world around us in positive ways has a positive impact upon our mood. 
    <br><br>
    *Moderate Your News Intake.
    While it is important to stay apprised of current events, watching too much news isn’t good for your mental health.
    <br><br>
    *Integrate Faith.
    Faith provides hope and purpose, especially in the midst of difficult times. Participating in a faith community provides structure and a group of people to connect with who share similar beliefs. 
    <br><br>
    *Seek Help When You Need It.
    Feeling stressed is perfectly normal! However, ongoing stress impacts the body and can easily begin to negatively impact mental health. If you find yourself feeling depressed or anxious in ways that are negatively impacting your quality of life, seek assistance.
