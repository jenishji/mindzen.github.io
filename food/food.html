                <p>
                    Bananas are the ultimate mood changer, They’re high in vitamin B6, which helps synthesize feel-good neurotransmitters 
                    like dopamine and serotonin. Bananas are considered low-glycemic food (The glycemic index is used in a low glycemic 
                    diet to discover which foods have the least impact on blood sugar levels. Choosing low glycemic foods can aid with 
                    blood sugar regulation and weight loss.)
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Bananas also contain serotonin which is the key hormone that stabilizes our mood, feelings of well-being, and happiness. 
                    This hormone impacts our entire body.</p>
                    <br><br>
                <p>It enables brain cells and other nervous system cells to communicate with each other, although the form of serotonin found 
                    in bananas doesn’t cross the blood-brain barrier which means it can’t get into the brain to supplement the serotonin that’s 
                    naturally produced by the body.</p>

                <p>
                    This deep purple root vegetable has a sweet flavor and is very healthy. Vitamins A, B, and C, oxalates, iron, folate, 
                    magnesium, and potassium, antioxidants, fiber, and protein are all abundant in red beets.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Beetroots are high in nitrates, which are transformed into nitrites after being cooked. Nitrites cause the blood arteries 
                    that deliver oxygen to the brain to dilate.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>More blood flows to the brain as blood arteries dilate, and with increased blood flow comes higher oxygen flow. This technique 
                    improves blood flow to parts of the brain that are poor in oxygen</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Reduced oxygen reaching the brain is one of the causes of dementia and associated symptoms. Beets are high in choline, which 
                    promotes memory by generating the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Both of these systems operate together to prevent the onset 
                    of dementia.</p>

                    Orange is one of the most popular fruits on earth, Oranges are also a good source of fiber, B vitamins, vitamin A, calcium, 
                    and potassium but are mostly known for their high vitamin C content.

                <p>
                    Their high folate levels improve the efficacy of antidepressant medications. Hesperidin has additional advantages, such as 
                    preventing neurodegenerative disorders. Because low thiamine levels are linked to dementia, increased thiamine concentrations 
                    in oranges may provide similar advantages.

                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Oranges also contain several nutrients that are known to be beneficial to the nervous system, including potassium and different 
                    antioxidants. Folate has been linked to a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive impairment. Potassium has been 
                    associated with improved cognition, concentration, and neuronal activity as well as increased blood supply to the brain.

                <p>
                    Eating blueberries for depression may help in getting rid of your depression because blueberry seems to exhibit similar effects as valproic acid, which is a mood-stabilizing medication that helps regulate emotions.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    The antioxidant flavonoid anthocyanin found in blueberries has been linked to lower inflammation and the risk of depression. Finally, they contain vitamin C, which may help to alleviate the detrimental effects of stress. Blueberries also contain amounts of resveratrol, an antioxidant pigment that has been linked to relief from depression.

                    Seaweed is rich in micronutrients, trace elements, minerals, vitamins, and essential fatty acids including omega-3s,

                <p>
                    One of the advantages of seaweed is that many species are high in prebiotics, which provides the fiber needed for good bacteria to develop in the human GI tract

                    This fully ripened green pepper packs twice the amount of vitamin C as the unripe variant. Red peppers contain vitamin B6 which helps your brain produce serotonin and norepinephrine, two chemicals that affect your mood.

                    Coconut oil contains one of the most effective fats for reducing depression, memory loss, and stress relief. One of the causes is the MCT fats found in coconut, which bypasses digestion and is absorbed right away.

                    Spinach is a superfood, it contains serotonin which is a neurotransmitter that floats in our brain and gives us the feel-good factor, The tryptophan found in spinach also helps to increase serotonin production in the brain.
